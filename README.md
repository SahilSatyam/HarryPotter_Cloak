# HarryPotter_Cloak

Hey Folks,

This is my project of making Invisible Cloak using an **Image Processing** technique called **Colour Detection and Segmentation**. I have implemented this using Python and OpenCV.

colour detection and segmentation


We first have to take a single color cloth that must not contain any other color. I used a green color cloth for my project.
We then install openCV and implement the following steps:
1.Initialize the camera.
2.Capture and Store a single frame(background) before starting.
3.Detect the color of the cloth and create a mask.
4.Apply the mask on frames.
5.Combine the masked frames together.
6.Remove the unnecessary noise from masks.
